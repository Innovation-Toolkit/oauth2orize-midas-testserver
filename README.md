# OAuth2orize

OAuth2orize is an authorization server toolkit for Node.js.  It provides a suite
of middleware that, combined with [Passport](http://passportjs.org/)
authentication middleware and application-specific route handlers, can be used
to assemble a server that implements the [OAuth 2.0](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-28)
protocol.

This project is forked from Jared Hanson's [OAuth2orize](https://github.com/jaredhanson/oauth2orize)

## Purpose

This repository is being used as a modified example/test OAuth2.0 server for use
with the [midas platform](https://github.com/Innovation-Toolkit/midas).

Ignore all of the main development files and instead navigate to `examples/express2`

    $ npm install
    $ node app.js
